{% include base_path %}

I am a PhD student in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Washington, working under the supervision of Prof. Trevor Cohen. My research focuses on developing and applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques to address healthcare challenges, with particular emphasis on mental health applications, bias detection in clinical conversations, and accessible technology design for elderly populations.

## Research Interests

My research spans several key areas:

- **Mental Health AI**: Developing NLP models for detecting PTSD and other mental health conditions from clinical interviews
- **Bias Detection**: Creating automated systems to detect and mitigate bias in patient-provider clinical conversations
- **Accessible Technology**: Designing user-centered LLM-powered chatbots for elderly populations
- **Clinical Data Analysis**: Processing and analyzing electronic health records for improved patient care

## Current Projects

- **PTSD Detection**: Comparative analysis of transformer-based and embedding-based NLP models for PTSD classification from clinical transcripts
- **Social Signals Analysis**: Automated detection of biased social signals in patient-provider clinical dialogs using NLP
- **Elderly Technology**: User-centered design of LLM-powered chatbots for retirement communities
- **Clinical Signatures**: Developing data-driven clinical signatures for people with hallucinations using multimodal data

## Background

I received my Master of Biomedical Informatics from Harvard Medical School and my BS in Biochemistry & Computer Science from Brandeis University. My work experience includes positions at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Intern and at Gordian Ventures as an Investment Intern.
