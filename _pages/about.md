I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Washington, working with Prof. Trevor Cohen. My research focuses on natural language processing for healthcare applications, particularly in developing models to detect social signals in clinical conversations, analyze PTSD in clinical interviews, and create data-driven clinical signatures for people with hallucinations.

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for clinical applications
- **Large Language Models (LLM)** for healthcare
- **Clinical Informatics** and data-driven healthcare
- **Bias detection and mitigation** in healthcare AI
