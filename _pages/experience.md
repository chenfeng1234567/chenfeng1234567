Research Experience
======
**University of Washington** | Advisor: Prof. Trevor Cohen | Seattle, WA
* **Natural Language Processing for Social Signals Detection in Patient-Provider Clinical Dialogs** (Sep 2023 - Present)
  * Utilized ASR (Whisper) and speaker diarization (Pyannote) to transcribe and analyze patient-clinician conversations
  * Applied multiple NLP and LLM models to train and classify the social signals scores for patients and clinicians
  * Investigated implicit racial bias in clinical dialogs and optimized predictive performance for detecting social signals

* **Comparative Analysis of LLMs in Detecting PTSD in Clinical Interviews** (Jan 2025 - Present)
  * Developed and compared transformer-based and embedding-based NLP models (e.g., Mental-RoBERTa, SentenceBERT, LLaMA) for PTSD classification from clinical transcripts
  * Implemented prompt-based PTSD classification using LLaMA with DSM-5-informed prompts
  * Conducted error analysis on symptom severity and depression comorbidity, revealing model sensitivity to clinical subtleties

* **Developing Data-driven Clinical Signatures for People with Hallucinations** (Mar 2024 - Present)
  * Building automatic pipeline to derive multimodal data-driven clinical signatures from mobile behavioral tasks to predict individual differences in severe negative outcomes among people experiencing hallucinations
  * Developed and improved automatic sentence coherence measurement package to evaluate verbal recall tasks audio recordings
  * Identifying and mitigating bias in automatic speech recognition and predictive models across demographic groups

* **LLM-based Chatbot Design for the Elderly Community** (Mar 2024 - Present)
  * Designed and developed an LLM-powered chatbot to improve life for residents at a retirement community
  * Conducted user interviews and training sessions to refine features like adjustable font sizes, high-contrast modes, and voice-to-text support
  * Engineered prompts to ensure clear responses and implement interface to enhance accessibility and user satisfaction

**Harvard Medical School** | Advisors: Dr. Li Zhou & Prof. Pengyu Hong | Longwood, MA
* **Bias and Missingness Handling in the Task of Mortality Prediction for ARDS** (Feb 2022 - Dec 2022)
  * Preprocessed MIMIC-IV data and retrieved data for ARDS patients with ICU ventilation data
  * Built a workflow to impute missing values based on different types of missingness with four imputation methods
  * Used propensity score matching to detect and narrow the bias in the data and compared the machine learning model performance for mortality prediction
  * Helped to apply for grants for the project for the lab in the project of handling bias in EHR data

* **Paper Review for Bias in Healthcare AI Applications using EHR data** (Dec 2022 - Dec 2023)
  * Used scripts and key-word search to extract paper related to bias handling application healthcare AI and followed the flow of PRISMA workflow to manual review and filter over 200 papers
  * Reviewed the full text of the paper and form recorded the evaluation metrics, detailed methods and classified types of bias and methods to handle bias
  * Published a systematic review paper that summarizes the results of bias handling in EHR data to JAMIA

**Brandeis University** | Advisors: Prof. Hongfu Liu & Prof. Pengyu Hong | Waltham, MA
* **Virus-host Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 Predicted by a Network-based Cross-species Model** (Mar 2020 - Aug 2020)
  * Researched the virus-host interactions of other published coronaviruses and compared SARS-CoV-2 with them after multiple sequence alignment in terms of domains, functions and mutations
  * Built graphs presenting sequence similarities in viral and host proteins and networks of the protein-protein interaction
  * Performed graph embedding and used deep learning to train a network-based cross-species model; used it to predict the highly potential PPI and pathways of SARS-CoV-2 among animals

* **The Prediction of SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Using Deep Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms** (Apr 2020 - Sep 2021)
  * Collected the data of the identified SARS-CoV-2 mutations along the time and location of their occurrences and analyzed the datasets to calculate the mutation rates and identify the hot zone
  * Built a model with evolutionary algorithms and GAN to predict the mutation of SARS-CoV-2 based on its mutation history
  * Studied the mutation influence on the 3-D structure of the virus proteins

**Massachusetts Institute of Technology** | Advisor: Prof. Jean-Francois Hamel | Cambridge, MA & Online
* **Testing Simulators for Bioreactors and Optimizing Parameters for Vaccine Productions** (Jan 2020 - Aug 2020)
  * Learned and used bioreactor simulators to cultivate cells and study the bioprocesses for both mammalian and yeast cells
  * Researched experimental settings for vaccine production, performed tests using AAV on the simulators and compared with experimental results
  * Wrote weekly reports and a summary report about the optimal environment for the potential expanded-scale production

Work Experience
======
**Amazon** | Software Development Engineer Intern | Bellevue, WA (May 2022 - Aug 2022)
* Developed and optimized the algorithm for the shortest path calculation for the Supply Chain Optimization group
* Used clustering and machine learning methods to find the optimal partition the logistic network for transportation
* Visualized the network before and after the optimization as well as the statistics the algorithm improved

**Gordian Ventures** | Investment Intern | Shanghai, China (Mar 2023 - Aug 2023)
* New technologies research including t-RNA, Aptamers, Brain-computer interfaces and write publish information book
