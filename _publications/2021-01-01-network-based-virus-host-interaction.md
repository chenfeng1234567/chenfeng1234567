This paper presents a network-based approach to predict virus-host protein interactions. We researched virus-host interactions of published coronaviruses and compared SARS-CoV-2 with them after multiple sequence alignment in terms of domains, functions, and mutations. Our model used graph embedding and deep learning to train a network-based cross-species model to predict the highly potential protein-protein interactions and pathways of SARS-CoV-2 among animals.
