This research investigates virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 using a network-based cross-species model. We researched the virus-host interactions of other published coronaviruses and compared SARS-CoV-2 with them after multiple sequence alignment in terms of domains, functions and mutations. We built graphs presenting sequence similarities in viral and host proteins and networks of protein-protein interactions. Using graph embedding and deep learning techniques, we trained a network-based cross-species model to predict highly potential protein-protein interactions and pathways of SARS-CoV-2 among animals. Our approach provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential therapeutic targets.
