This systematic review examines bias handling methods in healthcare AI applications using electronic health records (EHR) data. We conducted a comprehensive literature search following the PRISMA workflow to identify and analyze over 200 papers related to bias handling in healthcare AI applications. Our review systematically categorizes different types of bias encountered in EHR data and evaluates various methods for bias detection and mitigation. We provide a comprehensive overview of evaluation metrics, detailed methodologies, and classification frameworks for bias types and handling approaches. The review highlights the importance of addressing bias in healthcare AI systems to ensure equitable and reliable clinical decision support tools.
