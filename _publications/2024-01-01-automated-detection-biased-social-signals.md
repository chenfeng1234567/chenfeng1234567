This research investigates the use of natural language processing techniques to automatically detect and analyze social signals in patient-provider clinical conversations. We utilize automatic speech recognition (Whisper) and speaker diarization (Pyannote) to transcribe and segment patient-clinician conversations, then apply multiple NLP and large language model approaches to classify social signals scores for both patients and clinicians. The study specifically examines implicit racial bias in clinical dialogs and optimizes predictive performance for detecting social signals. Our approach demonstrates the potential for automated bias detection in healthcare communication, contributing to more equitable patient care.
