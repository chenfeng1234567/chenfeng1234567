This research presents a comprehensive comparison of transformer-based and embedding-based natural language processing models for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) classification from clinical interview transcripts. We evaluate multiple approaches including Mental-RoBERTa, SentenceBERT, and LLaMA models, implementing prompt-based PTSD classification using DSM-5-informed prompts. Our analysis includes error analysis on symptom severity and depression comorbidity, revealing model sensitivity to clinical subtleties. The study demonstrates the potential of large language models in mental health assessment while highlighting the importance of clinical validation and bias mitigation in automated diagnostic tools.
