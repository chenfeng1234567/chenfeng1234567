This research presents a comprehensive user-centered design approach for developing LLM-powered chatbots specifically tailored for elderly users in retirement communities. We conducted extensive user interviews and training sessions with retirement community residents to understand their unique needs and challenges when interacting with technology. Based on these insights, we designed and refined an LLM-powered chatbot with accessibility features including adjustable font sizes, high-contrast modes, voice-to-text support, and simplified navigation. The chatbot was engineered with carefully crafted prompts to ensure clear responses and enhanced accessibility. Our findings demonstrate the importance of user-centered design in creating technology solutions that truly serve the needs of elderly populations.
