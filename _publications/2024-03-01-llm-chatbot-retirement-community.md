This study investigates how LLM-powered chatbots can help improve technology and eHealth literacy among elderly residents in retirement communities. We designed and developed an LLM-powered chatbot specifically tailored for elderly users, conducting user interviews and training sessions to refine features such as adjustable font sizes, high-contrast modes, and voice-to-text support. We engineered prompts to ensure clear responses and implemented an interface focused on enhancing accessibility and user satisfaction.
